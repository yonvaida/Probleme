This project is an Snake multiplayer Game.

Here is source code and compiled files.

How to run:
  1. Download the compiledFiles directory and run SnakeServer.exe
  2. If you want to use C++ client you need to just run SnakeClient.exe
  3. If you want a web client need to run snakeWebServer.exe . After snakeWebServer is runing, on localhost webserver need to put files
        from snakewebclient, and than go to http://localhost 
  
  
  Thanks.
